# Pierre's Treat Box üç∞

#### Friday Project for Week 5 of C# || Many-to-Many relationships with Authentication and Identity 1/8/2020

#### by Taylor Delph

## Description

  Pierre wants you to create a new application to market his sweet and savory treats. This time, he would like you to build an application with user authentication and a many-to-many relationship. Here are the features he wants in the application:

* The application should have user authentication. A user should be able to log in and log out. 
* Only logged in users should have create, update and delete functionality. All users should be able to have read functionality.
* There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.
* A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.

## üíª  Software Requirements
* A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* With [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer) installed
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914)

  * Click the 'No thanks, just start my download' link.
  * Follow along with the installer until you reach the Configuration page. Then select the following options:
  * Use Legacy Password Encryption.
  * Set password to **epicodus** and then click **Finish**.
  * Open the terminal and enter the command `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql//bin:$PATH"'>>~/.bash_profile`
  * Type `source ~/.bash_profile` in the terminal to verify that MySQL was installed.
  * Enter `mysql -uroot -pepicodus` or `mysql -uroot -p{your_password}` in the terminal to verify the installation. You will know it's installed when you gain access to the `mysql>` command line.


* [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
  * Select the 'No thanks, just start my download' link.
  * Install MySQL Workbench in the Applications folder.
  * Open MySQL Workbench and select the `Local instance 3306` server. You will need to enter the password **epicodus** (or the password you set).


## üèóÔ∏è  Setup and Use via cloning
* Open your terminal and ensure you are within the directory you'd like the file to be created in.
* Enter the following command `$ git clone https://github.com/taylulz/Factory.git`
* Once cloned, use the `$ cd Factory.Solution/Factory` command to navigate to the root directory.
* Enter `$ dotnet restore`


#### AppSettings.Json
* Create a file in Factory/Factory folder named `appsettings.json`
* Copy and paste the following snippet to the file (if you used your own password, replace 'epicodus' with the one you've set)

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=taylor_delph;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```

#### Import Database with Entity Framework Core
* Now enter `$ dotnet ef database update` to create database in MySQL.
* To run the application, enter `$ dotnet run`
* Your command line will open a server (likely `http://localhost:5000/`). Navigate to this URL in your browser to view the project.

#### Register and Login 
* To use this app, follow the directions to register an account
* After registering, login to begin making custom treats and adding flavors

#### Import Database with SQL Schema
* Copy and paste the following Schema Create Statement in MySQL Workbench to create this database with it's respective tables.
```
